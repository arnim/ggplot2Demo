# ggplot2 Demo

[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

### Usage

Itâ€™s hard to succinctly describe how ggplot2 works because it embodies a deep philosophy of visualisation. However, in most cases you start with ggplot(), supply a dataset and aesthetic mapping (with aes()). You then add on layers (like geom_point() or geom_histogram()), scales (like scale_colour_brewer()), faceting specifications (like facet_wrap()) and coordinate systems (like coord_flip()).

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + 
  geom_point()
```
